# Facial-Recognition-GUI
This project aims to recognize faces and store them on a local database. Each face that is not recognized will be classified 'unknown' until the user enters the persons name. Additionally users will be able to search the database  for information about each person who has been recorded. WIth further code this may can be applied to several industries or simply for educational purposes.
