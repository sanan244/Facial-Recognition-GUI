# Facial-Recognition-GUI
This project aims to recognize faces and store them on a local database. Each face that is not recognized will be classified 'unknown' until the user enters the persons name. Additionally users will be able to search the database  for information about each person who has been recorded. This project was not finalized for public use, certain variables are specific to the author's file system. The project serves an educational purpose.
